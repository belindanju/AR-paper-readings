# Overview 

Hello, my name is [Tian Guo](https://tianguo.info/) I am a computer science professor at WPI. 
This site tracks interesting developments and research on augmented reality (AR), as well as my personal reading notes. 

## Why This Site? 

A large part of my job is research, which roughly divides into keeping up with SToA, advising students, hands-on projects, and writing grant proposals. 

To officially kick start my NSF CAREER project *Toward a Specialized Edge for Augmented Reality*, I will spend some parts of my sabbatical year to organize impactful works in the field of AR. 

## Relevant Conferences 

Here are the list of conferences, not in any particular order, which I find each paper. 

- MobiSys 
- MobiCom 
- IEEE VR 
- IPSN 
- SenSys 
- CVPR 
- ECCV
